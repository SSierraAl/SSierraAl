  🔭  I'm on an exciting journey to shake things up in Flow Cytometry with a new laser technique. By tapping into Optical Feedback Interferometry, or OFI for short, I'm working on a game-changing way to analyze particles in fluids. Think of it like finding a needle in a haystack, but the needle is a cancer cell in a blood sample. It's all about pushing the boundaries of this technique and  how we diagnose diseases.

  🌱 Electronic Engineer with a master's focused on deploying ML in embedded systems, I've transitioned from developing predictive ML software for oil and gas industries to the deploy of ML models and signal procesing techniques for optoelectronics and embedded systems.
